<p>This is a dashboard for tracking the COVID19 outbreak and spread in India using network connections and clusters. Volunteers at covid19india.org, a crowdsourced database compiled from numerous news and governmental sources, are the main source of the data.</p>

<p>You may fork this and link it to your Google sheet as well. The goal of this graph is to give policy and decision makers more options for analysis so they can be more strategic when evaluating situations and allocating resources like ventilators, beds, and medications.</p>

<p>Enhanced cluster filters based on state, district, foreign trip, etc. Via <a href="https://0nol.com">adva optical networking</a></p>

<p>Using NLP to analyze the Notes section, you can learn about your relationships, travels, and other things.</p>

<p>Travel patterns of patients, including dates and places of stays.</p>

<p>Any database based on Google Sheets can be connected to this app. It currently based on the crowdsourced patient database at covid19india.org. To make it function online, edit client secrets.json and change the endpoint in the /api folder to hook it to your own. Then, deploy to zeit.co.</p>

<p>Are you authorized? No.</p>

<p>What sources do you use? How is the data for this project gathered?</p>

<p>We update our numbers based on official handles and state advisories. A team of volunteers verifies the information before it is published into a Google sheet and an API. Everyone can access the API at api.covid19india.org. We would appreciate it if you could utilize this information to combat this infection. Here is a list of sources.</p>

<p>Why are the numbers on <a href="https://covid19india.org">covid19india.org</a> different from those on the MOHFW website?</p>

<p>The data is updated by MoHFW on a regular basis. The state press releases, official (CM, Health M) handles, PBI, Press Trust of India, and ANI stories are what we update them based on. These tend to be more recent.</p>

<p>Where can I locate the relevant data?</p>

<p>Here at api.covid19india.org, all the data is accessible through an API for additional research and development.</p>

<p>So who are you?</p>

<p>We are a team of devoted volunteers who curate and check the information obtained from various sources. To identify local and community transmissions, we extract information about a patient's relationships with other patients, travel history, and status. We never keep or disclose any information that could be used to identify a patient.</p>

<p>Why are you investing your time and money on this when you will never make a dime off of it?</p>

<p>because it has an impact on us all. The infection is currently affecting someone else, but tomorrow it might affect us as well. We must stop this infection from spreading. We must record the facts so that knowledgeable individuals can utilize it to guide their judgments.</p>
